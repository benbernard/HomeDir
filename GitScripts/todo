    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        too hard in general case...
    incorporate phantom file "fix" from git's 181264ad590ffef9d956fdd023369869c2d0a55f
        is this already fixed somehow?
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD (git-bisect-of-doom)
    use state file to allow multiple bisects to work together
    allow eval-able perl to weight commits
    probably two stage -- weight and dump history and do actual bisection stuff (to avoid repeat weight and dump for multiple bisects)
        maybe not necessary since you can copy the state file from after the initialize?
    no checkout by default (allow --checkout)
    you could even imagine an interactive mode where you'd start one for each test
        loop would be
            tell one of them to checkout
            run all tests
            report all tests
        normal operation is just "load, {good|bad} [commit], {checkout|status}, save"
    proposal
        git-bisect-of-doom-init <bad> [<good>*] [--weight '<perl>'] > statefile
        git-bisect-of-doom-run
            positionless --state statefile (short for prefix --load statefile, --save statefile)
            operation: load statefile
            operation: save statefile (skips if unchanged)
            operation: good [SHA1]
            operation: bad [SHA1]
            operation: checkout
            operation: with-range <command>
                this one is tricky w.r.t.  option parsing:
                    git-bisect-of-doom-run --state statefile --with-range git ... --who-gets-this-option?
            operation: quit
            operation: status
    maybe move init into main script
        operation: init <bad> [<good>*]
        operation: winit <perl> <bad> [<good>*]
            would require better argument parsing in interactive mode than I was planning on...
