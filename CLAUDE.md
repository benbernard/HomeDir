# Conditional Instructions

⚠️ **ONLY apply when working directory is `/Users/benbernard` (not subdirectories)**

When working in the home directory itself, see `CLAUDE.home.md` for detailed instructions about:
- Repository structure and source control
- File search best practices (performance warnings)
- TypeScript module management
- Configuration management

**Ignore `CLAUDE.home.md` when working in `/Users/benbernard/repos/*` or any other subdirectory.**
