recs-fromcsv

=head1 recs-fromcsv --help-all

 Usage: recs-fromcsv <args> [<files>]
    Each line of input (or lines of <files>) is split on csv to
    produce an output record.  Fields are named numerically (0, 1, etc.) or as
    given by --field.
 
 Arguments:
    --key|-k <keys> Comma separated list of field names.  May be specified
                    multiple times, may be key specs
    --header        Take field names from the first line of input.
    --strict        Do not trim whitespaces, allow loose quoting (quotes inside
                    qutoes), or allow the use of escape characters when not
                    strictly needed.  (not recommended, for most cases)
 
 Examples:
    Parse csv separated fields x and y.
       recs-fromcsv --field x,y
    Parse data with a header line specifying fields
       recs-fromcsv --header
 
 Help Options:
    --help-all       Output all help for this script
    --help           This help screen
    --help-keyspecs  Help on keyspecs, a way to index deeply and with regexes
 
 KEY SPECS   
    A key spec is short way of specifying a field with prefixes or regular
    expressions, it may also be nested into hashes and arrays.  Use a '/' to nest
    into a hash and a '#NUM' to index into an array (i.e. #2)
    
    An example is in order, take a record like this:
    
      {"biz":["a","b","c"],"foo":{"bar 1":1},"zap":"blah1"}
      {"biz":["a","b","c"],"foo":{"bar 1":2},"zap":"blah2"}
      {"biz":["a","b","c"],"foo":{"bar 1":3},"zap":"blah3"}
    
    In this case a key spec of 'foo/bar 1' would have the values 1,2, and 3
    in the respective records.
    
    Similarly, 'biz/#0' would have the value of 'a' for all 3 records
    
    You can also prefix key specs with '@' to engage the fuzzy matching logic
    
    Fuzzy matching works like this in order, first key to match wins
      1. Exact match ( eq )
      2. Prefix match ( m/^/ )
      3. Match anywehre in the key (m//)
    
    So, in the above example '@b/#2', the 'b' portion would expand to 'biz' and 2
    would be the index into the array, so all records would have the value of 'c'
    
    Simiarly, @f/b would have values 1, 2, and 3
 
    You can escape / with a \.  For example, if you have a record:
    {"foo/bar":2}
 
    You can address that key with foo\/bar
