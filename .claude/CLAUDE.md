- When making changes to files, at the end of the task, always run lints and
type-checks.
- Consider running tests.  If you have changed a test file at all you *must* always
run it.
- Never commit with --no-verify!!! NEVER.  If things aren't working, you may need to install new deps with 'npm install'
- Never make git commits unless instructed to do so
